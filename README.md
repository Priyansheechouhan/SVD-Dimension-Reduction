# 📘 SVD Dimension Reduction — Machine Learning Project
A simple and intuitive implementation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for dimensionality reduction, deployed on Render.
This project demonstrates how high-dimensional datasets can be compressed into lower dimensions while retaining the most important patterns,
improving both model performance and efficiency.

## 🚀 Project Overview

- High-dimensional datasets often contain:

- Redundant information

- High noise

- Correlated features

These issues affect the performance and training speed of ML models.
This project uses SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) to extract the most meaningful latent features from the data and perform dimensionality reduction.

The reduced data is then passed to the ML model for training and evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand how SVD works for dimensionality reduction

- Apply SVD on numeric datasets

- Reduce feature space from high dimensions to fewer latent features

- Train a model on original vs reduced data

- Compare performance

- Deploy the project on Render for real-time inference
